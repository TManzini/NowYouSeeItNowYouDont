# Now you see it, Now you don’t: Damage Label Agreement in Drone & Satellite Post-Disaster Imagery
This repo contains the code necessary to replicate the results of the FAccT'25 paper "Now you see it, Now you don’t: Damage Label Agreement in Drone & Satellite Post-Disaster Imagery." 

To replicate the results, you can run the contents of [FAccT'25_Replicate.bat](https://github.com/TManzini/NowYouSeeItNowYouDont/blob/main/FAccT'25_Replicate.bat). This script will install all dependencies, download all necessary data, and run the scripts that will replicate the results.

The above bat script will download all necessary data. However, it can be downloaded independently from the [CRASAR-U-DROIDs dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CRASAR/CRASAR-U-DROIDs/) at commit ID: [76fa52105ca607cb4563c746d37fb638825b8a26](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CRASAR/CRASAR-U-DROIDs/tree/76fa52105ca607cb4563c746d37fb638825b8a26).
